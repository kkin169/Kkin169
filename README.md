### Hi there 👋🏾

I am currently learning more about multiple data reporting methods.

Ask me about what it was like to learn Computer Programming from 1996 to 1998 at a Technical School in Florida.

Ask me about how data is handled by office clerical staff and what their mistakes might look like from Dev view.

Ask me about how far legal redaction has come when it comes to personally protected data.

And I would like to learn more about anything you have to share, please feel free to reach out.
